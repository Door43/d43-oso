====== Balaam ======

===== Facts: =====

Balaam was a pagan prophet whom King Balek hired to curse Israel while they were camped at the Jordan River in northern Moab, preparing to enter the land of Canaan.

  * Balaam was from the city of Pethor, which was located in the region around the Euphrates River, about 400 miles away from the land of Moab.
  * The Midianite king, Balek, was afraid of the strength and numbers of the Israelites, so he hired Balaam to curse them.
  * An angel of God stood in the path so that Balaam's donkey stopped. God also gave the donkey the ability to speak to Balaam.
  * God did not allow Balaam to curse the Israelites and commanded him to bless them instead.
  * Later however, Balaam still brought evil on the Israelites when he influenced them to worship the false god Baal-peor.
