Antioch was the name of two cities in the New Testament. One was in Syria, near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The other was in Pisidia, near the city of Colosse.

  * The local church at Antioch of Syria and was the first place where believers in Jesus were called "Christians." The church there was also active in sending out missionaries to reach the Gentiles.
