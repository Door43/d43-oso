====== Biblical Time: Month ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "month" refers to a period of time lasting about four weeks. In the lunar calendar, which was used in Biblical times, each month lasted 29 days.

  * In the widely-used solar calendar, the number of days in each month and the number of months in each year are based on the number of days it takes the earth to go around the sun (about 365 days). There are 12 months per year in this system, with the length of each month ranging from 28 to 31 days.
  * In the lunar calendar, the length of each month is based on the amount of time it takes for the moon to go around the earth, about 28 days.
  * The "new moon," or beginning phase of the moon with its sliver of light, marks the beginning of each month in the lunar calendar.
  * The Israelites used the lunar calendar, so all the months referred to in the Bible are those of the lunar calendar. Modern Jews still use dthe lunar calendar for religious purposes.
