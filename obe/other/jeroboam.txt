====== Jeroboam ======

===== Facts: =====

Jeroboam son of Nebat was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel around 900-910 BC. Another king named Jeroboam son of Jehoash ruled over Israel about 120 years later. Sometimes they are referred to as "Jeroboam 1" and "Jeroboam 2."

  * Jeroboam son of Nebat caused the ten northern tribes of Israel to separate themselves from the rest of Israel and to follow him as their ruler. He was a very wicked king. He encouraged the people of the kingdom of Israel to worship idols, instead of worshiping Yahweh.
  * The kings who ruled Israel after Jeroboam followed his evil example.
  * Almost 120 years later, another king named Jeroboam began ruling the northern kingdom of Israel. This Jeroboam was the son of King Joash and was wicked like all the previous kings of Israel had been.
  * In spite of this, God had mercy on Israel and helped this King Jeroboam to gain land and establish boundaries for their territory.
