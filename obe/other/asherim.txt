====== Asherah, Asherah poles ======

===== Definition: =====

Asherah was the name of a goddess that was worshiped by Canaanite people groups during Old Testament times.

  * The term "Asherah poles" refers to carved wooden images or carved trees that were made to represent this goddess.
  * Asherah poles were often set up near altars that had been made for the false god Baal, who was thought of as Asherah's husband.
  * God commanded the Israelites to destroy all the carved images of Asherah.
  * Some Isrealite leaders like Gideon, King Asa, and King Josiah obeyed God and led the people in destroying these idols.
  * But other Israelite leaders such as King Solomon, King Manasseh, and King Ahab did not get rid of the Asherim and instead influenced the people of Israel to worship these idols.
