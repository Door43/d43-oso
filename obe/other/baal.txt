====== Baal ======

===== Facts: =====

Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

  * The name "Baal" means "lord" and was falsely believed to be the most powerful god who caused the land to produce more crops and who helped people have more children. The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the only true Lord and God who created the universe and who alone causes it to flourish.
  * The worship of Baal included practices that were immoral, including sacrificing children and prostitution.
  * At different times throughout their history, the Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
  * During the reign of King Ahab, God's prophet Elijah set up a test to prove to the people that Baal does not exist and that Yahweh is the only true God.
  * As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and turned back to worshiping Yahweh.
  * There were also local false gods that took the name Baal as part of their names, such as Baal of Peor.
  * some people had names that included the word "Baal" in them.
