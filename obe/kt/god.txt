====== God ======

===== Facts: =====

In the Bible, the term "God" refers to the eternal being who created the universe out of nothing. God exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God's personal name is "Yahweh."

  * God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.
  * He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.
  * God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.
  * He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.
  * People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.
  * God revealed his name as "Yahweh" which means, "he is" or "I am" or "the One who (always) exists."
  * The Bible also teaches about false "gods" which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Ways to translate "God" could include, "Deity" or "Creator" or "Supreme Being."
  * Other ways to translate "God" could be, "Supreme Creator" or "Infinite Sovereign Lord" or "Eternal Supreme Being."
  * Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for "God" in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.
  * Many languages capitalize the first letter of the word for the one true God, to distinguish it from the word for a false god. 
  * Another way to make this distinction would be to use two different terms for "God" and "god."
  * The phrase, "I will be their God and they will be my people" could also be translated as, "I, God, will rule over these people and they will worship me."
