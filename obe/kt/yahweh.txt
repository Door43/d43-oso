====== Yahweh ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "Yahweh" is God's personal name that he revealed to Moses at the burning bush.

  * The name "Yahweh" comes from the word meaning "to be."
  * Possible meanings include, "he is" or "I am" or "the one who causes to be."
  * This name reveals that God has always lived and will continue to live forever. It also means that he is always present.
  * Many Bible versions in major languages (such as English, French, and Spanish) have used an equivalent of "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh." For example, "I am the LORD your God" is literally, "I am Yahweh your God."
  * however, the ULB and UDB always translate God's personal name as "Yahweh," the way it literally occurs in the Old Testament.
  * In the New Testament, the personal name "Yahweh" does not occur. Instead, the term "Lord" is used in quotes from Old Testament verses. 

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term could be translated by a word or phrase that means "I am" or "living one" or "the one who is" or "he who is alive."
  * This term could also be written in a similar way to how "Yahweh" is spelled.
  * Note that "Jehovah" is //not// a good translation of this term. In the past, the Jews said "Lord" instead of Yahweh and eventually some people took the vowels from the Hebrew word for Lord and replaced the vowels in the Hebrew word Yahweh. This resulted in the contrived spelling, "Jehovah," which is //not// an accurate way to spell God's personal name.
