====== unleavened bread ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "unleavened bread" refers to bread that has been baked without yeast, or any other leavening substance. Unleavened bread does not rise, so it is flat.

  * When God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, he told them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. So they ate unleavened bread with their meal. Since then unleavened bread is used in their yearly Passover celebrations to remind them of that time.
  * Since leaven sometimes is used as a picture of sin, "unleavened bread" represents the removal of sin and living in a way that honors God.to urge fellow believers to live in a way that is sincere and truthful toward others.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Other ways to translate this term could include, "bread with no yeast" or "flat bread that did not rise."
  * Make sure the translation of this term is consistent with how you translate the term "yeast, leaven."
