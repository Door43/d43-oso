====== apostle, apostleship ======

===== Definition: =====

The "apostles" were men sent by Jesus to preach about God and his kingdom. The term "apostleship" refers to the position and authority of those who were chosen as apostles.

  * The word "apostle" means, "someone who is sent out for a special purpose." The apostle has the same authority as the one who sent him.
  * Jesus' twelve closest disciples became the first apostles. Other men, such as Paul and James, also became apostles.
  * By God's power, the apostles were able to boldly preach the gospel and heal people, including forcing demons to come out of people.


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The word "apostle" can also be translated with a word or phrase that means, "someone who is sent out" or "sent out one" or "person who is called to go out and preach God's message to people."
  * It is important to translate the terms "apostle" and "disciple" in different ways from each other.
  * Also consider how this term was translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]])
