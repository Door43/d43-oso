====== vow ======

===== Definition: =====

A vow is a promise that a person makes to God. The person promises to do a certain thing in order to specially honor God or to show devotion to him.

  * After a person makes a vow, he is obligated to fulfill that vow.
  * The Bible teaches that a person may be judged by God if he doesn't keep his vow.
  * Sometimes a person may ask God to protect him or provide for him in exchange for making the vow.
  * But God is not required to fulfill a request that a person asks for in his vow.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, “vow” could be translated as “solemn promise” or “promise made to God.”
  * This word should be translated differently than "oath."
