===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If the idioms using "right hand" do not have the same meaning in the language of translation, then consider whether the project language has a different idiom with the same meaning. (See: [[:oso:ta:vol2:translate:figs_idiom]])

These two ways of saying the same thing emphasize this point. It could be translated as, "his amazing strength and mighty power." (See: [[:oso:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * If this would give a wrong meaning or would have no meaning in the language of translation, then a different idiom or term should be used.
