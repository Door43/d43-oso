The term "Sabbath" refers to the seventh day of the week which God commanded the Israelites to set apart as a day of rest and doing no work.

  * After God finished creating the world in six days, he rested on the seventh day. In the same way, God commanded the Israelites to set aside the seventh day as a special day to rest and worship him.
  * The command to "keep the Sabbath holy" is one of the ten commandments that God wrote on the stone tablets that he gave Moses for the Israelites.
  * Following the Jewish system of counting days, the Sabbath begins on Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown.

  * Some translations capitalize this term to show that it is a special day, as in, "Sabbath Day" or "Resting Day."
